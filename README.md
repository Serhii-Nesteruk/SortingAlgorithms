# SortingAlgorithms
This project is a collection of various sorting algorithms implemented in C++. These algorithms provide different approaches to efficiently organize elements in an array or a container.

## Algorithms Included

 ### 1. Bubble Sort
 • Implementation:  [BubbleSort.cpp](BubbleSort/BubbleSort.cpp) <br>
.                   [BubbleSort1.cpp](BubbleSort/BubbleSort1.cpp) <br>
.                   [BubbleSort2.cpp](BubbleSort/BubbleSort2.cpp) <br>
.                   [BubbleSort3.cpp](BubbleSort/BubbleSort3.cpp) <br>
.                   [BubbleSort4.cpp](BubbleSort/BubbleSort4.cpp) <br>
.                   [BubbleSort5.cpp](BubbleSort/BubbleSort5.cpp) <br>
 • Description: Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.<br>
### 2. Selection Sort
 • Implementation: [SelectionSort.cpp](SelectionSort/SelectionSort.cpp) <br>
 • Description: Selection Sort sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted part of the array and putting it at the beginning.
### 3. Insertion Sort
 • Implementation:   [InsertionSort.cpp](InsertionSort/InsertionSort.cpp) <br>
 .                   [BinaryInsertionSort.cpp](InsertionSort/BinaryInsertionSort.cpp) <br>
 • Description: Insertion Sort builds the final sorted array one item at a time. It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort.

## How to Use
### 1. Clone the repository:

   git clone https://github.com/your-username/sorting-algorithms-collection.git
````
### 2. Compile and run the desired sorting algorithm:
````
   g++ BubbleSort.cpp -o BubbleSort
   ./BubbleSort
````
